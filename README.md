## Objective
The purpose of this repository is to store my submissions for online programming contests. 

## Accounts
I'm currently practicing more through CodeChef and Hackerrank. These are my accounts: 

- https://www.codechef.com/users/iagosaito
- https://www.hackerrank.com/hisami

## Languages
I'm learning Go, so my recent submissions were in Go, but there are some in Java and, of course, SQL.
